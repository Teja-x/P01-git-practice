# P01 - Git Practice Repository

This repository is created as part of my Git learning journey. It contains sample programs and version control exercises using Git and GitHub.

## Purpose
To understand and apply core Git concepts such as:
- Initializing a Git repository
- Tracking file changes
- Committing updates
- Creating and switching branches
- Merging changes
- Connecting to remote GitHub repositories
- Pushing and pulling changes

## Concepts Covered
- `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`
- `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git merge`
- `git remote add`, `git push`, `git pull`
- GitHub integration and basic collaboration practices

## Files Included
- `HelloWorld.java` – My first Java file to test basic Git operations.
- `AreaOfSquare.java` – Practice for branch creation and merging.
- More files to be added as I continue exploring Git features.
